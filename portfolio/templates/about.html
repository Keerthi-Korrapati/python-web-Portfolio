        Hi, I am Keerthi and I love to develop web application using Flask!
    </p>
    <p>
        I love programming, I love to help others and 
        I enjoy exploring new technologies in general!
    </p> 
    <p>
        My goal is to keep on growing as a developer - and 
        if I could help you do the same, I'd be very happy!
    </p>
